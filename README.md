# cs189_project_neural_style_transfer

This project covers the use of Neural Style Transfer, how it works, and a few interesting examples using it. We assume the student has already seen Gradient Descent, Back Propagation, Convolutional Neural Networks, and how to use Pretrained Models. We will also use tensorflow, and briefly cover hyperparameter tuning, which would be useful for the student to know, but these topics are not necessary to master.

After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:

- Running pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models
- Understanding how different layers of a CNN process different features of an image
- Using pretrained models to extract features for use in other algorithms
- Using latent features to define similarity measurements between images
- Understanding the design of the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, including:
  - the loss functions it defines
  - how it uses gradient descent
  - the effect of different choices of hyperparameters

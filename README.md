# cs189_project_neural_style_transfer
After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:

- Running pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models
- Understanding how different layers of a CNN process different features of an image
- Using pretrained models to extract features for use in other algorithms
- Using latent features to define similarity measurements between images
- Understanding the design of the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, including:
  - the loss functions it defines
  - how it uses gradient descent
  - the effect of different choices of hyperparameters
